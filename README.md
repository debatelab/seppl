## Highlights

‚≠êÔ∏è Online e-Tutor that walks students through complex argumentation analysis problems.

‚≠êÔ∏è Structures the reconstruction workflow into high-level stages and individual steps.

‚≠êÔ∏è Provides instant feedback on the correctness of each individual reconstruction step and suggests improvements.

‚≠êÔ∏è Works with arbitrary argumentative source texts.

‚≠êÔ∏è User management for weekly assignments and global learning progress.

## Background

‚û°Ô∏è Conceives of argument reconstruction as a hermeneutical process, in which analysts constantly revise their logical reconstruction in line with different criteria:

- Plausibility and faithfulness of premises and conclusion.
- Inferential strength (e.g., deductive correctness) of the reconstructed argument.
- Dialectic function of the reconstructed argument in its given context.

‚û°Ô∏è Structures the reconstruction workflow into the following _stages_:

1. **Informal analysis**: note gist, title, main conclusion
2. **Premise-conclusion structure**: state premises, conclusion, intermediate conclusions
3. **Faithfulness**: identify quotes from source text that correspond to premises and conclusion
4. **Inference graph**: informally lay out the inferential relations between argument's propositions
5. **Deductive correctness**: formalize premises and conclusion, check deductive validity

‚û°Ô∏è Current _stage_ of the reconstruction process is determined by automatic evaluation of reconstruction given latest revision, so users may "fall back" and progress is non-cumulative.

‚û°Ô∏è Users may resume reconstruction from any previous state, allowing for branching and non-linear hermeneutical processes. 

‚û°Ô∏è Based on the [DeepA2 framework](https://debatelab.github.io/journal/deepa2.html) and custom T5 models fine-tuned on critical thinking datasets.

‚û°Ô∏è Software architecture: Uses decomposed prompting with various generative and loss LLM calls, organized as [chain of responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility).

‚û°Ô∏è Built in the summer 2022.

‚û°Ô∏è Deployed in winter term 2022/23 in critical thinking course at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.philosophie.kit.edu/).

‚û°Ô∏è Evaluated with a Teaching Analysis Poll (TAP) by the Methods Lab at the House of Competence (www.hoc.kit.edu) in collaboration with KIT's quality management services (https://www.sts.kit.edu/qualitaetsmanagement.php). üôè

### Prover9

There are issues with installing prover9.

> In compiling with gcc 7.4.0, we get error:
> 
> gcc  -O -Wall -lm -o prover9 prover9.o index_lits.o forward_subsume.o demodulate.o pred_elim.o unfold.o semantics.o giv_select.o white_black.o actions.o search.o utilities.o provers.o foffer.o ../ladr/libladr.a
> search.o: In function `search':
> search.c:(.text+0x6654): undefined reference to `round'
> 
> This is because the make directive is not of the correct (or new) format:

> 	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -lm -o prover9 prover9.o $(OBJECTS) ../ladr/libladr.a

> It should be:

> These defects can be fixed easily.
